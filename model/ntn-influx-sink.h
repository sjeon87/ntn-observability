 * time a Point reaches here its timestamp is final.
 *
 * Non-finite float fields (NaN / +-Inf) are skipped — they are invalid line
 * protocol and would cause InfluxDB to reject the WHOLE line. A Point left with
 * no fields at all is skipped entirely (a fieldless line is also invalid).

 *   - **UDP** (default; matches `influxdb_v1` UDP listener): low-overhead,
 *     fire-and-forget, lossy under MTU pressure.
 *   - **File**: appends line protocol to a local file. Used for offline
 *     scenarios and for the deterministic unit tests.
 *
 * HTTP/v2 transport is intentionally NOT in this module — it pulls in libcurl
 * and async event-loop concerns that fight with ns-3's discrete event
 * simulator. Users wanting v2 push: import the file dump with
 * `influx write` after the run.

     *
     * The toolkit has three export surfaces and they anchor time differently
     * ON PURPOSE, which was never written down anywhere and never tested:
     *
     *   - this sink adds a WALL-CLOCK base epoch (default: construction time),
     *     because a live Grafana query is "last 1 hour" and pure sim time would
     *     land every point in 1970;
     *   - NtnSceneRecorder's CZML uses a SCENARIO epoch
     *     (NtnSceneRecorder::kDefaultSceneEpochUnix), because a globe has to
     *     animate at the date the ephemeris is for;
     *   - the Python backend stamps datetime.now() when it accumulates.
     *
     * They are not interchangeable and the difference is not a defect. Being
     * unable to tell which one an artifact used IS: cross-referencing a CZML
     * timestamp against an Influx point was guesswork. This states it.
